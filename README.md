Hi! My name is Yara Sanchez (@sanchezy) and I am a Computational Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme at University College London (UCL) in United Kingdom. My research focuses on understanding the molecular basis of human development and disease through computational approaches.
Specifically, I am using a combination of high throughput single-cell mutiomics, spatial transcriptomics (Visium) and machine learning to understand cell-to-cell heterogeneity in complex diseases such as cancer and pregnancy complications.
